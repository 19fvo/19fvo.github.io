    <p>So this crappy game is just all about helping a wizard cut fruits using a wand (impossible???). You use the arrow keys to move him around to fruits, 
    and on contact, it will slice open and a new fruit will appear on a random point on the map.</p>

    <h3>What This Game is About:</h3>
    <p>So the game you see directly above the heading above this paragraph is a very terrible remake of the game osu!mania, which in turn is based off of 
    the popular rhythm game beatmania IIDX. The goal of the game is to make it through the song without letting your performance bar reach 0, with 
    successfully timed notes raising your performance bar and missed notes dropping your performance bar. All notes in the game are perfectly timed to the 
    rhythm of the song that is played. The S, D, F, Space, J, K, and L keyboard keys are used to play the game. I used a lot of broadcasting for majority of 
    the sprites and looped a few sections on different points of the song. That was the hardest part, as I tried for two whole hours to find a consistent 
    broadcasting structure about 4 other times before finding the right structure. But at the end of it all, just enjoy the game for what it is, not by the 
    work methods used to create it.</p>

    <h3>What the Hell is That Crap Above???</h3>
    <p>So in that giant picture above, what can be seen is a session of mine on the coding website Replit. The exposition of this story is that Baby Groot
    stole the Death Button from Rocket and he needs the help of the reader to get it back. It requires going to the fabled Planet Meme and traveling through 
    its Forest of Cringe, a laborious effort.</p> 
    <p>(a)How we built the story was that we mainly used one if-elif-else statement, which helped to diagram our whole story, and in order to allow the 
    reader to interact with the story, we added in many raw inputs to the story under the title "decision".</p>
    <p>(b)The main problem that arised while working on the story was that the raw inputs were not working the way we wanted it to, as it would sometimes 
    print out code that we didn't want to print out yet. We solved this by adding in separate raw inputs for each decision point.</p>
    <p>(c)The work was meant to be a joke story, so I didn't really try well to make a plot line or character development. There isn't anything I 
    particularly like, but I hated the way the story rolled out because it was just basically a meme fest.</p>
    <p>(d)I liked this one story where there was a burglar that was trying to kill a group of friends because of the way the story draws in the reader.</p>
    <p>(e)I would try to give it some character development and some more path decisions, considering the time crunch killed the story a lot.</p>
